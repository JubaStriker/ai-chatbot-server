      WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, TRANSFI DOES NOT GUARANTEE  THAT:   
      1. ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR PRODUCT AND RELATED SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR FREE FROM ERROR,   
      2. USAGE DATA PROVIDED THROUGH OUR PRODUCT AND RELATED SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE  
      3. OUR PRODUCT AND RELATED SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT, SERVICES, OR FEATURES MADE AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR  
      4. THAT ANY DATA THAT ANY USER DISCLOSES WHEN THEY USE OUR PRODUCT AND/OR RELATED SERVICES WILL BE SECURE.

      

      THERE ARE INHERENT SECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING ONLINE OVER THE INTERNET. TRANSFI HAS NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY UNLESS IT IS DUE TO THE TRANSFI’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE. 

   2. Interruption of service: The risks of using TransFi’s Product & services includes interruption of service or delays in service, some of which may be outside of TransFi’s control. This is because some of the services TransFi provides include services provided by third-party service providers. While We strive to ensure the reliability and security of all payment methods offered through Our platform, We cannot and do not guarantee the performance, availability, or security of services provided by third-party service providers.   
   3. Use of third-party services: Our Services may utilize third-party service providers, which may require You, Your Clients or their End Users to agree to separate agreements with them. By using Our services, You agree to comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement. We are not a party to these agreements, and we assume no responsibility for the products and services provided by third parties.   
   4. Third-party service providers disclaimer: TransFi will facilitate the creation and management of Wallets for Users and End Users through third-party service providers, who shall be solely responsible for key management, wallet security, and compliance with applicable regulations related to Wallets. TransFi is not liable for any losses arising from Wallet services provided by third-party service providers, including key management failures, as they are solely responsible for the management and security of the wallets. TransFi disclaims all liability for any loss, breach, or failure arising from the third-party service provider’s management of custodial wallets. The Customer indemnifies and holds TransFi harmless against any claims, losses, or damages arising from the third-party service provider’s failure to perform its Wallet responsibilities.  
   5. Risk Disclosures, Assumption of Risks, and Release of TransFi: Other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement, TransFi shall not be liable for any risks inherent in the Gaming services or related transactions or losses, including Wallet transactions, that may be incurred by the End User or the Customer and their Clients as a result thereof. The End User, Customer, and Client agree to and do hereby:   
      (i) release TransFi from any and all liability related to or arising from risks inherent in the Gaming services and related transactions, including Wallet transactions, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, and   
      (ii) assume all risks inherent in the Gaming services and related transactions, including but not limited to the following:  
* The risk that any third party service providers of TransFi ceases to operate, rendering a transaction impossible and entirely without use.  
* The market for crypto assets may collapse without warning or discernible logic.  
* There is a risk that changes in Applicable Law could adversely affect the End User’s right to legally use, transfer, exchange, and/or obtain value from crypto assets. It may be illegal, now or in the future, to own, hold, sell, or use crypto assets in one or more countries.   
* Transactions in crypto assets are, as a rule, irreversible. Consequently, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions are generally not recoverable. Once a transaction has been recorded on the approved network, it is not reversible. The End User acknowledges that it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or fraud, crypto assets could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties.  
* Some transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on the approved network, which is not necessarily the date or time that the End User initiated the transaction.  
* Crypto assets may be targets of fraud and cyber-attacks. On Devices and Wallets, such fraud and attacks can result in total loss to the End User. In the  Wallet, TransFi makes commercially reasonable efforts to verify that the End User is the true initiator of transactions, but where the End User’s account is compromised, such efforts may fail and could result in total loss of crypto assets in the Wallet. Attacks on TransFi may also result in unplanned and significant unscheduled downtime during which transactions will not be executed. Absent fraud or intentional wrongdoing on the part of TransFi, TransFi shall not be liable for End User losses on account of any of the foregoing circumstances or compromised account credentials. As a good faith holder of crypto assets in the Wallet, there is a risk that the End User will lose possession thereof if TransFi determines that it was previously transferred by fraudulent means, or transferred otherwise in violation of this Agreement, even if the End User had no part in the wrongdoing.  
* The Services and crypto assets rely on the internet, which includes third-party hardware, software, and internet connections, all of which may suffer communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions, or delays that might affect the End User’s ability to access and use Services such as the account and Wallet.

  (iii) The Customer and Clients shall ensure that all End Users and Users carry out their own independent analysis and assessment of the risks specific to the Gaming services and related transactions.

   1.

This Agreement does not grant the Customer any rights to TransFi’s intellectual property (including any rights in respect to the TransFi API and TransFi Widget), and any goodwill, rights, and benefits that arise from their use. For the avoidance of doubt, any Client of the Customer or any End User shall retain all right, title and interest in any personal data; provided that TransFi is entitled to retain and use such information as allowed by TransFi’s [Privacy policy](https://www.transfi.com/policies#privacy-policy).

    3. The services shown in Appendix 2 are modular in nature. The Customer can choose one or many of the services as per their requirements.  
    4. Customer will pay all such taxes, duties, charges or levies fully without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding of any kind. For the avoidance of doubt, TransFi shall under no circumstances be responsible or liable for any such taxes, duties, charges or levies associated with the Services, and the Customer hereby indemnifies TransFi for any claim made in respect thereof.  
    5. Customer is obliged to pay all invoices within thirty (30) days of receipt from TransFi. Any invoices remaining unpaid thirty (30) days after the invoice date shall be considered overdue. Overdue invoices will incur interest at a rate of 3% above the prevailing Bank of England base rate, compounded monthly. This interest shall be applied on a monthly basis from the invoice due date until outstanding amounts have been paid in full.  
    6. TransFi reserves the right to suspend services if payment is not received within sixty (60) days of the original invoice date. If services are suspended, re-instatement will only occur once all outstanding invoices and accrued interest have been settled.

Neither Party shall be liable for damages arising from delays or problems caused by telecommunication carriers, internet service providers, other communication networks, blockchains or blockchain systems, any doings of any exchange or the banking system.  
    4. Limitation of Liability: The maximum aggregate liability of Parties for any and all claims whatsoever arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be limited to the amount paid to TransFi by the Customer in the preceding 12 months.

    5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability cap shall not apply to the Customer or the Customer’s Clients, Merchants, or with respect to fraud recalls, chargebacks, fines, penalties, or other financial losses incurred as a result of their respective breaches of the Agreement or any misconduct or omissions in connection with the Agreement. Customer agrees to assume unlimited liability for:

       A. Regulatory fines and penalties imposed due to the Customer's or its Clients', or its Merchants' non-compliance with applicable laws, fraudulent activities, or other unlawful conduct in connection with the performance of the Agreement;

       B. Stuck or restricted funds – any amounts frozen, withheld, or otherwise made inaccessible by payment processors, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, or any other authorities as a result of breaches of the Agreement or any misconduct or omissions by the Customer, its Clients, or Merchants in connection with the Agreement;

       C. Any liabilities resulting from claims initiated by third parties as a result of acts or omissions, non-compliance with applicable laws or regulatory requirements, fraudulent activity, or any other unlawful conduct by the Customer, its Clients, or Merchants in connection with the performance of the Agreement.

    6. Wilful default or fraud: Nothing in this Agreement will:

       1. exclude or restrict a Party’s liability which cannot by operation of Applicable Law be excluded or restricted; or

       2. exclude or restrict any claim which is directly attributable to the Parties’ wilful default or fraud.

 

14. Chargebacks and Risk Management  
1.  Chargeback Liability:  
   The Customer acknowledges and agrees that all liability arising from Chargebacks, including fraud recalls and related obligations, rests solely with the Customer. TransFi reserves the right to impose a rolling reserve, withhold balances, or require a security deposit from the Customer, as deemed necessary, to address potential or actual Chargeback claims.

2.  Liability for Customers:  
   The Customer shall bear full responsibility for all Chargebacks and related liabilities arising from its transactions or those of its Clients, Merchants, and End Users. This includes any fines, penalties, or costs incurred due to the actions or omissions of the Customer or its Clients, Merchants, and End Users.

3. Right to Withhold, Recover Funds, and Security Deposit:  
   In the event of a Chargeback or fraud recall:  
   (i) If the Customer's balance held by TransFi, including any rolling reserve or security deposit, is insufficient to cover the Chargeback amount and associated costs, TransFi reserves the right to demand the shortfall from the Customer; and  
   (ii) TransFi may withhold, set off, or deduct funds from any future settlements or remittances due to the Customer to recover outstanding amounts.

4. Transaction Validity and Non-Settlement:  
   TransFi shall have the right to present non-settled transactions from the Customer to issuing banks, regulators, or other authorities for verification. In the event of disputes or objections such entities raise, TransFi shall not be obligated to settle the disputed transaction amounts until such disputes are resolved.

5. Chargeback Costs:  
   All Chargebacks shall correspond to the whole or part of the settlement value of the original transaction. The Customer shall be liable for:  
    (i) The full amount of the relevant Chargeback; and  
    (ii) Any costs, expenses, liabilities, or fines incurred by TransFi or its affiliates in connection with such Chargeback ("Chargeback Costs").

6. Recovery of Chargebacks:  
   A Chargeback represents an immediate liability from the Customer to TransFi. If the full amount of any Chargeback or Chargeback Costs cannot be recovered from the Customer’s balance, rolling reserve, security deposit, or withheld funds, then TransFi shall be entitled to recover the outstanding amounts by invoicing or issuing a credit note to the Customer or through any other lawful means.

7. Excessive Chargebacks:  
   If, at TransFi’s sole discretion, the volume or value of Chargebacks or fraud recalls is deemed excessive or unreasonable, TransFi may terminate your access to the Services or any BSA if signed between TransFi and the Customer, or take any other actions necessary to protect its interests.

8. Rolling Reserve:  
   A rolling reserve may be maintained at a percentage of the Customer’s transactions, ranging between two percent (2%) and ten percent (10%), with the specific percentage and reserve period ranging between seven (7) and ninety (90) days, both determined at TransFi’s sole discretion based on the Customer’s risk profile, transaction history, and other relevant factors. The rolling reserve may also be imposed or modified later at TransFi’s discretion if Chargebacks increase.

9. Final and Binding Decisions:  
   TransFi is not obligated to investigate the validity of any Chargeback decision made by an issuing bank, payment scheme, or financial institution. Such decisions are final and binding on the Customer.

10. Post-Termination Liability:  
    The Customer acknowledges and agrees that its liability for Chargebacks, fraud recalls, refunds, penalties, and related costs shall survive the termination of the Services or any BSA if signed between TransFi and the Customer.

15. Force Majeure  
    1. No Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in its performance under this Agreement (other than performance of payment) due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, including without limitation, acts of God, acts of war or terrorism, unauthorized actions of third parties, governmental actions and equipment, telecommunications, power or electrical failures, pandemic.

Change of control: In the event of a merger or reorganization of the Customer, or any change in the control of the Customer or any transfer of a substantial part of the business thereof, the Customer shall notify TransFi in writing thereof no later than 14 days prior to the occurrence of such an event, and TransFi reserves the right to terminate the Agreement without notice in such an event.  
    8. No Waiver: The failure, delay or omission of either Party to give notice of default or to enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver, or future waiver, of its right to assert or rely upon such provision or any other provision of this Agreement. No waiver or breach of any provision will be deemed a waiver of any other provision, and no waiver will be valid unless it is in writing and executed by the waiving party.
